# Let git treat all files as non-text when doing line-ending-normalization, disabling it completely:
* text=false

# Never modify line endings for the following:
*.xml -text
*.md5 -text
*.sha1 -text
*.pom -text
*.test -text

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
*.jar binary
