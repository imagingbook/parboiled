# Let git treat all files as non-text when doing line-ending-normalization, disabling it completely:
* text=false

# Never modify line endings for the following (this is redundant):
*.xml -text
*.md5 -text
*.sha1 -text
*.pom -text
*.test -text
*.java -text
*.scala -tex

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
*.jar binary
